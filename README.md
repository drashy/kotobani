CHANGING THE LANGUAGE :
Out of the box, Kotobani comes currently set up for german (locale de_DE). To switch to english, you will have to delete (or rename) the file "options.gd" and rename the file "FOR_ENGLISH_RENAME_TO_options.gd" to "options.gd". This will be possible in-game soon, but ... alpha ... oh .. and lazy ...

TOOLS :
I included to add new words to the dictionary, as many words are still missing. add_de adds words to the german dictionary, add_en to the english one. You can build them yourself by downloading and intalling the go compiler from http://golang.org/ (click the big "download" button on the right side) and then executing in the command line, in the correct directory, "go build add_en" or "go build add_de"
